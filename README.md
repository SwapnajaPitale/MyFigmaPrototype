My first Figma prototype for a class assignment

I am creating a website prototype for coffee shop that enables usersâ€™ place their coffee orders in advance, get notified when the order will be ready for pick-up. The website also offers feature for group ordering with a timed shareable hyperlink so that users can send it to other people they are ordering for and all individual orders are grouped within a single main order.
My user persona is Alia, an Intern at a Multinational Marketing Firm, who needs a faster, collaborative way to take coffee orders for her colleagues because taking remembering each order individually takes a toll on her mental energy.
